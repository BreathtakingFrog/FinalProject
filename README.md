# FinalProject
Airline Tickets
In our EndTerm project we want to create a console application through which users can buy tickets online. We will connect our project to the database which will store the data of users who have already registered in the application. The application will have various functions, one of which is a list of my passengers. There you enter all the personal data of the user and it will be stored there. So when you buy tickets for more than one person all you have to do is select the users already stored in your history, instead of having to enter each user's details manually every time.
Also we will use exception handling with it in case of wrong data entry the program will not close automatically, but just ask the user to enter the data back. With this we make the session end only if the user decides to do it himself. 
In this project we will use different types of classes. One of the main classes is user authentication. We will use it to identify users and determine what data they have access to. There will also be a class for registering users and adding passenger data to my classes. There will also be classes like connectSQL, execSQL, a class for booking tickets, etc.
We used the Singleton pattern to save memory and code usability. 
We created a check-in menu that only accepts specific data entry that meets the criteria.
We created a primitive menu that will allow the user to select some functions: buy tickets, reserve a seat, view a profile.
The database was implemented using an ERD diagram that we created in advance.
